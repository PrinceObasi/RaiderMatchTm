## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd raidermatch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## üìß Email Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `RESEND_API_KEY`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # then open .env.local and paste your key
   ```

Or via Supabase CLI:
```bash
supabase functions secrets set RESEND_API_KEY <your-key>
supabase functions deploy notify_employer
```

Or via Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí add RESEND_API_KEY.

## üîÆ Next Steps for Full Implementation

To complete the full-stack implementation, you would need to:

### 1. Database Setup (Supabase)
```sql
-- Students table
CREATE TABLE students (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  gpa NUMERIC,
  resume_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Employers table  
CREATE TABLE employers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  company TEXT NOT NULL,
  contact_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Jobs table
CREATE TABLE jobs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  employer_id UUID REFERENCES employers(id),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  location TEXT NOT NULL,
  posted_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Applications table
CREATE TABLE applications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id),
  job_id UUID REFERENCES jobs(id),
  hire_score NUMERIC,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'applied',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Backend API Routes
- `POST /api/upload-resume` - Resume storage and parsing
- `GET /api/match?student_id=` - Matching algorithm
- `POST /api/apply` - Application submission
- `POST /api/employer/invite` - Interview invitations

### 3. Authentication Integration
- Supabase Auth integration
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Protected routes and middleware

### 4. File Storage
